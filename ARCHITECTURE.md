# RSS2ICal

Provide an on-demand source of truth for dynamically filtered RSS feeds to be consumed by GCal or Apple Calendar.

## Goals
- Provide a stable endpoint that converts an RSS feed to iCalendar format
- Ensure up-to-date calendar data is always available on-demand
- Support integration with major calendar applications (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, etc.)
- Minimize server load and response time

## Non-Goals
- Active push notifications to calendar applications
- User authentication or personalized feeds
- Support for multiple RSS feeds or user-provided RSS URLs
- Complex event processing or modification

## Dependencies
- Go programming language (version 1.16+)
- External libraries:
  - github.com/arran4/golang-ical (for iCalendar generation)
  - encoding/xml (standard library, for RSS parsing)
- Web server capable of running Go applications

## Architecture

### Components

1. HTTP Server
   - Listens for incoming GET requests
   - Handles routing to appropriate handlers

2. RSS Fetcher
   - Periodically fetches the RSS feed from the specified URL
   - Implements error handling and retry logic

3. RSS Parser
   - Parses the XML content of the RSS feed
   - Extracts relevant event information

4. iCalendar Generator
   - Converts parsed RSS data into iCalendar format
   - Utilizes the golang-ical library

5. Cache Manager
   - Stores the latest generated iCalendar data
   - Manages cache invalidation and updates

6. Request Handler
   - Serves the iCalendar data to clients
   - Implements appropriate HTTP headers

### Data Flow

1. The RSS Fetcher periodically retrieves the RSS feed.
2. The RSS Parser extracts event information from the feed.
3. The iCalendar Generator converts the parsed data to iCalendar format.
4. The Cache Manager stores the generated iCalendar data.
5. When a request is received, the Request Handler serves the cached iCalendar data.

### Key Considerations

- Caching: Implement an efficient caching mechanism to reduce load on the RSS source and improve response times.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling for RSS fetching, parsing, and serving requests.
- Rate Limiting: Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.
- Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring to track usage and identify issues.

## API

Endpoint: `/calendar`
Method: GET
Response: 
- Content-Type: text/calendar
- Body: iCalendar formatted data

## Scalability

The current architecture is designed for a single RSS feed. For future scalability:
- Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy deployment and scaling.
- Implement a database to support multiple feeds if needed in the future.
- Consider using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for load balancing if high traffic is expected.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the server is properly configured and kept updated.
- Implement HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Consider implementing request validation to prevent potential abuse.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Implement logging for error tracking and usage statistics.
- Set up alerts for critical errors (e.g., persistent failures in RSS fetching).
- Regularly review and update dependencies to address potential security vulnerabilities.
